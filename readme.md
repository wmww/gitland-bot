This is my attempt at building a bot for [gitland](https://github.com/programical/gitland)

It is designed to be panic-happy rather than trying to recover from errors, with the idea that the script that runs it will notice and send out alerts.

src/ai is where my bot's logic would live, except I'm not pushing that to a public repo for obvious reasons.

What's here you're free to use.
